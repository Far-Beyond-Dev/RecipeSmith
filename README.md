# RecipeSmith

RecipeSmith is a Rust-based module designed by asterisk for use with games that utilize the stars beyond horizon Server Backend as a framework for managing recipes, ingredients, and their interactions within a recipe book. This system integrates with PebbleVault for data storage and retrieval while being capable of communication with other submodules, ensuring modularity and independence. The goal is to enable dynamic recipe management, including creating, storing, retrieving, and crafting recipes based on available ingredients.

## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Management:** Create, store, retrieve, and craft recipes based on available ingredients.
- **Integration with PebbleVault:** Seamless data storage and retrieval with PebbleVault.
- **Modularity:** Designed to communicate with other submodules independently.
- **Ingredient Interaction:** Detailed tracking and management of ingredients and their quantities.
- **Outcome Prediction:** Automatically determine the outcome of recipes based on input ingredients.
- **Loosely Coupled Architecture:** Ensures components can function independently, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
- **Full Error Logging Functionality:** Comprehensive error logging to facilitate debugging and maintain system integrity.
- **Server Independence:** Operates without dependency on a central server, allowing for distributed and offline use cases.
- **Extendable and Customizable:** Easily extendable to add new features or customize existing ones to fit specific needs.

## How It Works

### Recipe Structure

Recipes are defined in a JSON file containing the name, ingredients, and outcome of each recipe. Here is an example structure:

```json
{
    "_comment": "Recipes JSON file containing various recipes and their ingredients.",
    "recipes": [
        {
            "name": "Bread",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Flour", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Water", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Salt", "quantity": 1}
            ],
            "outcome": "Bread"
        },
        {
            "name": "Cake",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Flour", "quantity": 3},
                {"name": "Sugar", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Egg", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Milk", "quantity": 1}
            ],
            "outcome": "Cake"
        },
        {
            "name": "Potion",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Herb", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Water", "quantity": 1}
            ],
            "outcome": "Health Potion"
        },
        {
            "name": "Stew",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Meat", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Potato", "quantity": 3},
                {"name": "Carrot", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Water", "quantity": 2}
            ],
            "outcome": "Stew"
        },
        {
            "name": "Salad",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Lettuce", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Tomato", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Cucumber", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Olive Oil", "quantity": 1}
            ],
            "outcome": "Salad"
        },
        {
            "name": "Sandwich",
            "ingredients": [
                {"name": "Bread", "quantity": 2},
                {"name": "Ham", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Cheese", "quantity": 1},
                {"name": "Lettuce", "quantity": 1}
            ],
            "outcome": "Sandwich"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Integration with PebbleVault

## Example Usage in an RPG Game

### Integration into an RPG Game

1. **Define Recipes and Ingredients:**
   - Use the JSON structure provided by RecipeSmith to define various recipes and their required ingredients.

2. **Crafting System:**
   - Implement a crafting system in your RPG game that interacts with RecipeSmith. Players can collect ingredients and use the crafting system to create new items.

3. **Storage and Retrieval:**
   - Integrate PebbleVault to store and retrieve recipes and ingredients, allowing players to save their progress and access it later.

4. **Outcome Determination:**
   - Use RecipeSmithâ€™s outcome prediction feature to automatically determine the result of combining different ingredients.

### Example Workflow

1. **Collect Ingredients:**
   - Players gather ingredients during gameplay (e.g., Flour, Water, Salt).

2. **Open Crafting Menu:**
   - Players open the crafting menu where they can see available recipes.

3. **Select Recipe:**
   - Players select a recipe (e.g., Bread) and see the required ingredients.

4. **Craft Item:**
   - Players combine the required ingredients and craft the item, resulting in the outcome (e.g., Bread).

### Example Code Snippet

```rs
use recipesmith::{Recipe, Ingredient};

fn main() {
    let flour = Ingredient::new("Flour", 2);
    let water = Ingredient::new("Water", 1);
    let salt = Ingredient::new("Salt", 1);

    let bread_recipe = Recipe::new("Bread", vec![flour, water, salt], "Bread");

    let crafted_item = bread_recipe.craft();
    println!("Crafted Item: {}", crafted_item);
}
```
